  * HKUST & WeBank
  * **Best Paper Award!**
  * A scheduling system for serverless functions to _minimize resource provisioning costs_ while _meeting the function latency requirements_
  * Overcommit functions based on their past resource usage; Identify nine low-level metrics (e.g., request load, resource allocation, contention on shared resources); Use the Mondrian Forest to predict the function performance
  * Employ a conservative exploration-exploitation strategy for request routing; By default, route requests to non-overcommitted instances; Explore to use overcommitted instances
  * Vertical scaling to dynamically adjust the concurrency of overcommitted instances

  * Huawei
  * Industry Paper
  * Two new serverless traces in Huawei Cloud

    * Requests vary by up to 9 orders of magnitude across functions, with some functions executed over 1 billion times per day
    * Scheduling time, execution time and cold-start distributions vary across 2 to 4 orders of magnitude and have very long tails
