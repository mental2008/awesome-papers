## Understanding the paper

As mentioned in the paper, Swin Transformer is **a new vision transformer (ViT)**, which serves as **a general-purpose backbone** for computer vision.

"Interesting" points:

1. Excellent results in many tasks. (Is really good?)
2. The authors argue that _the hierarchical design_ and _the shifted window approach_ can be applied for all-MLP architectures efficiently.
3. The code is open-sourced in GitHub.
