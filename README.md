# Introduction

> Think different. — Apple

Hi all, thank you for visiting here ;-) These are my personal paper reading notes.

## Workflow

~~The typical workflow of reading a paper is as follows:~~

1. ~~If finds something interesting, it's warmly welcomed to create an issue and add a few metadata from the paper in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mental2008/awesome-papers).~~
2. ~~After a quick glance, I will attempt to answer [5c questions](https://paper.yanglingyun.me/research-skills/how-to-read-a-paper#the-first-pass) and comment directly in the issue. The paper will be marked as `further-reading` if necessary.~~
3. ~~For the papers that I have read, I will make notes accordingly. Every once in a while, my reading notes will be reorganized and uploaded to [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mental2008/awesome-papers), which can be visible on the [website](https://paper.yanglingyun.me).~~

I abandoned the previous workflow as it was difficult to maintain.

In practice, commenting directly on GitHub issues isn't particularly convenient for a few reasons:

1. The whole process needs to be done online, and editing Markdown on the web is not as good an experience as it could be.
2. It's not very easy to organize the GitHub issues into the repository, including uploading images and managing files.
3. If someone watches the repository, frequent creation and modification of issues can cause problems for them.

After a few months of practice, I'm currently using [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) + [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to read papers, and the whole workflow can be done offline with considerable efficiency.

After some consideration, I'm going to manage this paper repository in the following way:

1. Every once in a while (tentatively a week), I will organize some interesting papers that I have read carefully during that time and upload their notes to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mental2008/awesome-papers), which can be read easily on the [website](https://paper.yanglingyun.me/).
2. If you find a paper that interests you in my reading notes, free free to [create an issue](https://github.com/mental2008/awesome-papers/issues/new) and have a conversation with me.
3. Even if the paper you are interested in is not in my notes, you can also [create an issue](https://github.com/mental2008/awesome-papers/issues/new) to let me know, and I will read it and give you my thoughts if I have time.
4. Welcome to [submit a pull request](https://github.com/mental2008/awesome-papers/pulls) if you find any typos.
