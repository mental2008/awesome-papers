# Introduction

> Think different. — Apple

Hi all, thank you for visiting here ;-) These are my personal paper reading notes.

## Workflow

1. I will aperiodically organize some interesting papers that I have read during my leisure and upload their notes to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mental2008/awesome-papers), which can be read easily on the [website](https://paper.yanglingyun.me/).
2. If you find a paper that interests you in my reading notes, free free to [create an issue](https://github.com/mental2008/awesome-papers/issues/new) and have a conversation with me.
3. Even if the paper you are interested in is not in my notes, you can also [create an issue](https://github.com/mental2008/awesome-papers/issues/new) to let me know, and I will read it and give you my thoughts if I have time.
4. Welcome to [submit a pull request](https://github.com/mental2008/awesome-papers/pulls) if you find any typos.

## Finally
