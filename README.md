# Introduction

> If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough. — Albert Einstein

Hi all, thank you for visiting here ;-) These are my personal paper reading notes. I have a broad interest in systems, machine learning, and other funny stuff.

## Welcome

1. I'll aperiodically organize some interesting papers that I have read during my leisure and upload their notes to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mental2008/awesome-papers), which can be read easily on the [website](https://paper.lingyunyang.com/).
2. I've organized a list of papers on several topics (mainly systems for ML) and also categorized the reading notes by conference/journal dates.
3. If you find a paper that interests you in my reading notes, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/mental2008/awesome-papers/issues/new) and chat with me.
4. Even if the paper you are interested in is not in my notes, you can also [create an issue](https://github.com/mental2008/awesome-papers/issues/new) to let me know, and I will read it and give you my thoughts if I have time.
5. Welcome to [submit a pull request](https://github.com/mental2008/awesome-papers/pulls) if you find any typos.
