## GPU Spatial Sharing

* Paella: Low-latency Model Serving with Software-defined GPU Scheduling (SOSP 2023) \[[Paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3600006.3613163)]
  * UPenn & DBOS, Inc.
* MuxFlow: Efficient and Safe GPU Sharing in Large-Scale Production Deep Learning Clusters (arXiv 2303.13803) \[[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13803)]
  * PKU & ByteDance
  * Utilize NVIDIA MPS
* NVIDIA Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) \[[Homepage](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/technologies/multi-instance-gpu/)]
  * Partition the GPU into as many as _seven instances_, each _fully isolated_ with its own high-bandwidth memory, cache, and compute cores.
  * Available for NVIDIA H100, A100, and A30 GPUs.
* NVIDIA Multi-Process Service (MPS) \[[Docs](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/mps/index.html)]
  * Transparently enable co-operative multi-process CUDA applications.
  * Terminating an MPS client without synchronizing with all outstanding GPU work (via Ctrl-C / program exception such as segfault / signals, etc.) can leave the MPS server and other MPS clients in an undefined state, which may result in hangs, unexpected failures, or corruptions.
* NVIDIA CUDA Multi-Stream \[[Docs](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-runtime-api/group\_\_CUDART\_\_STREAM.html)]
  * Stream: a sequence of operations that execute in issue-order on the GPU.
  * Perform multiple CUDA operations _simultaneously_.
