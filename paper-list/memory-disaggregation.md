* \[**DirectCXL** | KAIST | ATC 2022] [Direct access, high-performance memory disaggregation with DirectCXL](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc22/presentation/gouk)
  * The first work that brings CXL 2.0 into a real system and analyzes the performance characteristics.
  * For real-world applications, DirectCXL exhibits **3x** better performance than RDMA-based memory disaggregation.

  * Divide the swap space of each machine into many slabs and distribute them across many machines' remote memory.
  * Decentralized slab placements and evictions.
